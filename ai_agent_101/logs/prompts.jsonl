Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

While DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, it faced challenges such as endless repetition and language mixing. DeepSeek-R1 addresses these issues by incorporating cold-start data before RL, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across various tasks.\n\n### Model Development and Training\nThe development of DeepSeek-R1 involves a pipeline with two RL stages and two SFT stages. The RL stages focus on discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, while the SFT stages serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, marking a significant milestone in the research community.\n\n### Distillation and Smaller Models\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance. The open-source DeepSeek-R1 and its API benefit the research community by enabling the distillation of better smaller models. Several dense models, such as Qwen and Llama, have been fine-tuned using reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, achieving exceptional performance on benchmarks.\n\n### Evaluation Results\nDeepSeek-R1 and its distilled models have been evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in English, code, math, and Chinese tasks. The models achieve high scores in benchmarks like MMLU, DROP, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, showcasing their reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n### Usage Recommendations\nTo achieve optimal performance with DeepSeek-R1 models, it is recommended to set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 and avoid adding a system prompt. For mathematical problems, including a directive in the prompt to reason step by step is advisable. Additionally, enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" can enhance its reasoning engagement.\n\n### Licensing and Availability\nThe DeepSeek-R1 series is licensed under the MIT License, supporting commercial use and allowing modifications and derivative works. The distilled models are derived from Qwen and Llama series, originally licensed under Apache 2.0 and Llama licenses, respectively.\n\n### Contact and Further Information\nFor more details or inquiries, users can contact DeepSeek-AI via their official channels.\n\nBegin!

It builds upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, it faced challenges such as endless repetition and language mixing. DeepSeek-R1 addresses these issues by incorporating cold-start data before RL, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across various tasks.\n\n### Model Development and Training\nThe development of DeepSeek-R1 involves a pipeline with two RL stages and two SFT stages. The RL stages focus on discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, while the SFT stages serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, marking a significant milestone in the research community.\n\n### Distillation and Smaller Models\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance. The open-source DeepSeek-R1 and its API benefit the research community by enabling the distillation of better smaller models. Several dense models, such as Qwen and Llama, have been fine-tuned using reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, achieving exceptional performance on benchmarks.\n\n### Evaluation Results\nDeepSeek-R1 and its distilled models have been evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in English, code, math, and Chinese tasks. The models achieve high scores in benchmarks like MMLU, DROP, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, showcasing their reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n### Usage Recommendations\nTo achieve optimal performance with DeepSeek-R1 models, it is recommended to set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 and avoid adding a system prompt. For mathematical problems, including a directive in the prompt to reason step by step is advisable. Additionally, enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" can enhance its reasoning engagement.\n\n### Licensing and Availability\nThe DeepSeek-R1 series is licensed under the MIT License, supporting commercial use and allowing modifications and derivative works. The distilled models are derived from Qwen and Llama series, originally licensed under Apache 2.0 and Llama licenses, respectively.\n\n### Contact and Further Information\nFor more details or inquiries, users can contact DeepSeek-AI via their official channels.\n\nBegin!

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.

How to Run Locally\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1 Models\nPlease visit DeepSeek-V3 repo for more information about running DeepSeek-R1 locally.\nNOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.\n\t\tDeepSeek-R1-Distill Models\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.\nFor instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:\nvllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager\nYou can also easily start a service using SGLang\npython3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2\n\t\tUsage Recommendations\nWe recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:\nSet the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\nAvoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\nFor mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\nWhen evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\nAdditionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"<think>\\n\\n</think>\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance.\nTo ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"<think>\\n\" at the beginning of every output.\n\t\t7.

Introduction\nWe introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. \nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.\nWith RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,\nwe introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. \nTo support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\nNOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.\n\t\t2. Model Summary\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nWe directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\nWe introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.\nWe believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\nWe demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future. \nUsing the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n\t\t3.
