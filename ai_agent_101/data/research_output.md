### Summary of Key New Features of DeepSeek-R1

1. **Introduction of DeepSeek-R1**:
   - DeepSeek-R1 is a first-generation reasoning model developed to enhance reasoning performance.
   - It builds upon DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
   - DeepSeek-R1 addresses challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing encountered by DeepSeek-R1-Zero by incorporating cold-start data before RL.

2. **Performance and Open-Source Contribution**:
   - DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.
   - The model and its distilled versions are open-sourced to support the research community, with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforming OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks.

3. **Model Development Pipeline**:
   - The development pipeline includes two RL stages for discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, and two SFT stages for seeding reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.
   - This pipeline is expected to benefit the industry by creating better models.

4. **Distillation of Smaller Models**:
   - The reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance.
   - Several dense models have been fine-tuned using reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, and these distilled models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks.

5. **Evaluation Results**:
   - DeepSeek-R1 and its distilled models have been evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in English, code, math, and Chinese tasks.

6. **Usage Recommendations**:
   - Specific configurations are recommended for utilizing DeepSeek-R1 models to achieve optimal performance, such as setting the temperature within a certain range and including directives for mathematical problems.

7. **Licensing and Commercial Use**:
   - The DeepSeek-R1 series supports commercial use and allows for modifications and derivative works.
